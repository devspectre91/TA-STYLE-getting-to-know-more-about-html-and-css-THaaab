            Logan's life began in Cold Lake, Alberta, Canada, sometime between
            1882 and 1885.[73] The mutant who would come to be known simply as
            "Logan" was born James Howlett, the illegitimate son of Elizabeth
            Howlett (who was married to John Howlett, owner of a large estate)
            and the Howletts' groundskeeper, Thomas Logan. As a boy, James was
            notably frail and prone to bouts of allergic attacks. He was largely
            neglected by his mother, who had been institutionalized for a time
            following the death of her first son, John Jr.

            James spent most of his early years on the Howlett Estate grounds
            with two playmates that lived at the estate with him: Rose O'Hara, a
            red-headed Irish girl who was brought in from town to be a companion
            to young James, and a boy nicknamed "Dog", Thomas Logan's son (and
            James's half-brother). The children were close friends, but, as they
            reached adolescence, the abuse inflicted upon Dog warped his mind.
            Dog made unwanted advances towards Rose, which James reported to his
            father. In retaliation, Dog killed James' puppy, leading to the
            expulsion of Thomas and Dog from the estate

            As time passed, Logan’s powers grew; he became stronger, his healing
            factor slowly removed the traumatic memories of his childhood, he
            accepted his feral nature and he started to hunt with a pack of
            wolves. During this period, Logan developed strong feelings for
            Rose, but could not act on them for the sake of their guise as
            cousins. Smitty, who had been mentoring Logan all these years, had
            also grown close to Rose and the two eventually fell in love and
            became engaged, much to the scorn and surprise of Logan, who later
            accepted the situation for the sake of Rose's happiness.

          <h3>Powers and Abilities</h3>
          <p>
            Regenerative Healing Factor: Wolverine’s body naturally regenerates
            most (if not all) damaged or destroyed tissues and organs at a rate
            which exceeds that of any normal human. The rate of regeneration is
            proportional to the damage caused.[68] This process is automatic and
            Wolverine seems to have no control over it.[318] His healing factor,
            however, does not seem to stop Wolverine from feeling the pain of
            his wounds nor the pain of his body regenerating itself. The speed
            at which he heals has fluctuated considerably in recent years. After
            first losing his Adamantium, Wolverine's healing factor recovered
            and increased to a level far above his previous norm.[319][320]
            However, it was significantly reduced after his last encounter with
            Lazaer, the Angel of Death.[321] Its current effectiveness (after
            losing the healing factor, dying, and being resurrected with it
            intact) has not yet been compared to past values.Decelerated Aging:
            In addition, Wolverine's healing factor provides him with an
            extended lifespan by slowing the effects of the aging process;
            Wolverine was born sometime during the late 19th Century.[1]}
            Although well over 100 years of age, Wolverine retains the health,
            appearance and physical vitality of a man in the physical prime of
            his life. Retractable Bone Claws: Wolverine's skeleton includes six
            retractable foot-long bone claws, three in each arm, that are housed
            beneath the skin and muscle of his forearms. Wolverine could, at
            will, release these slightly curved claws through his skin between
            the knuckles on each hand. The bone claws are naturally sharp and
            tougher than normal human bone, allowing them to, even before they
            were infused with Adamantium they could penetrate most flesh and
            many natural materials.[68] After augmentation, his bones became
            indestructible and his claws are capable of piercing any material
            (relative to its thickness and the force Wolverine can exert).[68]
            The Adamantium bonding process which affected his bones effectively
            transformed them into a new alloy called "Adamantium-Beta"[329]
            which, combined with his healing factor, prevents his Adamantium
            skeleton from interfering with his bone marrows production of blood
            cells.[68] Wolverine can unsheathe any number of his claws at once,
            although he needs to keep his wrists straight at the moment his
            claws pass from his forearms into his hands.

          <h3>The Weapon X Experiment</h3>
          <p>
            In 1974,[104] before leaving Canada, while in his Lotus Seven, Logan
            was pumped full of Thorazine, beaten, and kidnapped by a group of
            armed men from the Weapon X Project, possibly under Romulus'
            orders.[105] The man known only as the Professor, Dr. Abraham
            Cornelius, and Dr. Carol Hines then began to examine Logan while he
            floated in a containment tank. Logan's skeleton, including his
            claws, was bonded with the indestructible metal known as Adamantium,
            making it unbreakable, and burying his personality beneath the most
            intense brainwashing he had ever undergone

          <h3>Meeting Mariko</h3>
          <p>
            When the X-Men traveled to Agarashima, Japan, Logan met Lady Mariko
            Yashida and aided her cousin, former X-Man Sunfire, in battling
            Moses Magnum. Although she was unable to reciprocate his feelings,
            Wolverine fell for Lady Mariko, heir to an extremely powerful Yakuza
            family in Tokyo. Initially frightened, Mariko was soon set at ease
            by Wolverine, who was attracted to her gentle demeanor, and both
            fell in love

            Max Eisenhardt,[1] aka "Magneto", the "Master of Magnetism"[15] is a
            powerful mutant with the ability to generate and control magnetic
            fields. Magneto regards mutants as evolutionary superior to humans
            and rejects the possibility of peaceful human-mutant coexistence; he
            aims to conquer the world to enable mutants, whom he refers to as
            Homo superior, to replace humans as the dominant species.

            Max was born and raised in Nuremberg, Germany by a middle class
            Jewish family. While attending a local school he became attracted to
            a young Romani girl named Magda, the daughter of the school cleaner.
            Max would do things such as create necklaces and excel in sporting
            events to gain her attention. While returning from school one day,
            Max encountered a Nazi rally and found his uncle Erich beaten and
            wearing a sign saying that he had shamed a German woman (as he was
            Jewish and she was not). Not long after, at a school event, Max won
            a javelin competition to impress Magda, and the following day was
            accused of cheating (following the belief that a Jewish boy could
            not exceed his classmates). Max was told to either give up his medal
            or recreate the throw with a "regulation" javelin. After winning the
            competition a second time, Max was again accused of cheating,
            expelled, and beaten by the other children

            While in Auschwitz, Max was reunited with Magda and continued to
            smuggle food and supplies to her. Max saved Magda from the gas
            chambers and then from execution; as the Sonderkommando revolted,
            the two of them escaped together. For several years, Max and Magda
            lived in a Carpathian mountain village, and eventually they were
            married. They had a daughter, Anya/p>

          <h3>X-Men and the Brotherhood</h3>
          <p>
            Professor Xavier's original team of X-Men thwarted Magneto's first
            act of genetic terrorism in his war with humanity, the takeover of
            the Cape Citadel missile base.[15] When they next clashed, Magneto
            overthrew the government of Santo Marco, setting himself up as
            absolute ruler, and led his original Brotherhood of Evil
            Mutants,[10] which included Wanda and Pietro, now known as the
            Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. Not until years later would Magneto
            learn that they were allegedly his children. After the X-Men
            liberated Santo Marco, Magneto kidnapped Angel and the X-Men
            followed to Asteroid M. Asteroid M was destroyed in the battle with
            the X-Men, when Scarlet Witch sabotaged a button, designed to kill
            the X-Men

          <h3>Powers and Abilities</h3>
          <p>
            Magneto was previously thought of being an Alpha-mutant,[177] but is
            currently considered to be an Omega Level Mutant.[164] He has been
            stated on several occasions to have been one of the most powerful
            mutants,[178][179][92][180] he has also been described for several
            times as the most powerful mutant,[181][182][183][179] Earth's most
            powerful super villain,[15][10] even the single most powerful being
            on the face of the Earth.[6] He possesses tremendous amounts of
            power, which is, for all practical purposes, limitless.[184] The
            upper limits of Magneto's power can't be surpassed in any measurable
            fashion. <br />
            Intelligence: A mastermind, Magneto is a genius in various
            scientific fields. He is an expert in genetic engineering and
            mutation. He has created artificial living beings, mutated humans in
            order to give them superhuman powers, instilled genetic
            mind-control, created adult clones of human beings, and manipulated
            the genetic structures of those clones during their development. His
            discoveries in particle physics would revolutionize the field and
            place him among the giants of scientific history if they were to be
            revealed.

          <h3>Last Days</h3>
          <p>
            After the events of World War Hate, Magneto found himself the leader
            of a band of mutant refugees on Genosha, who had just escaped the
            mutant concentration camps built by the Red Skull on the
            island.[134] He caught the attention of S.H.I.E.L.D., and
            surrendered to the authorities only to heavily damage the
            helicarrier from the inside and delete the agency's files on
            mutants.[135] Magneto was approached by Namor, who told him of the
            Incursions, an event in which two alternate universes collide with
            each universe's Earth as the point of impact. Namor was preparing to
            betray the Cabal and told Magneto about the Incursions because he
            believed that Magneto would do whatever possible to stop them

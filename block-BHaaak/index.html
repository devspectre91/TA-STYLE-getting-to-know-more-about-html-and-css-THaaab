          <p>
            Charles Francis Xavier was the mutant son of wealthy nuclear
            researcher, Dr. Brian Xavier, and his wife, Sharon Xavier-Marko.[22]
            While gestating in his mother's womb, Charles' twin was recognized
            by Charles as an evil presence and he preemptively tried to kill it
            with his nascent psychic abilities, causing the fetus'
            miscarriage.[23] After Dr. Xavier's death in an accident, Sharon
            married his colleague Dr. Kurt Marko who brought his son by a
            previous marriage, Cain Marko to live in their ancestral mansion.
            Dr. Marko favored the gentle, smart Charles over his own son, which
            led to Cain constantly bullying Charles and Dr. Marko secretly
            beating Cain. Sharon married Dr. Marko because she believed that it
            would be best for Charles
          </p>
          <p>
            Charles' telepathic powers began emerging when he was still a boy,
            around ten, and, as he grew older, he learned to control them. Due
            to the immense psychic energies emanating from Charles' head, he
            became bald at a young age. With his powers, Charles discovered that
            Dr. Marko married to his mother for her money, admitting that he was
            jealous of Dr. Xavier's wealth. Realizing Dr. Marko did not have
            feelings for Sharon, she started drinking, becoming an alcoholic.
            Marko started to abuse both Sharon and Cain, and Charles linked his
            mind to both of them. He telepathically linked to his mother's in an
            effort to share the abuse with her and alleviate it.
          </p>
          <p>
            On another occasion, he found himself experiencing the anguished
            thoughts and emotions of Cain, after Cain had been beaten by his
            father. Feeling Cain's pain aggravated Cain's dislike to Charles,
            but the inexperienced young Charles could not control or end his
            contact with Cain's mind at this time. Sharon died shortly
            thereafter of a broken heart, leaving Charles to live with his
            step-father and abusive step-brother.

          <h3>Meeting Moira</h3>
          <p>
            Xavier was approached by Moira Kinross during a fair in Oxford,
            asking him why he was smiling. He simply responded that recently, he
            had the "most wonderful dream", referring to his ideals of the
            peaceful coexistence between humans and mutants. Charles questioned
            Moira whether they have ever met before, which Moira responded to by
            asking him to read her mind, showing him all the lives she had
            already lived, a consequence of her mutant powers. Professor X was
            completely crushed by the experience, left thunderstruck by the
            revelation that no matter what would have happen, mutantkind would
            always lose. In her tenth and tentatively last life-cycle, all she
            ever wanted was for Professor X and Magneto to work together,
            avoiding mutants always losing as she saw in her past timelines.

          <h3>Powers and Abilities</h3>
          <p>
            Xavier is able to read minds and project his own thoughts into the
            minds of others within a radius of 250 miles (on Earth). With
            extreme effort he can greatly extend that radius. When synched with
            Cerebro or Cerebra, he can connect to every mind on a planet. After
            he was thrown into the M'kraan Crystal, it not only restored his
            mutation, but made his telepathy more powerful than it had been
            previously, thereby making him the world's most powerful telepath
            once again. <br />Genius Intelligence: A natural genius, Xavier is a
            leading authority on genetics, mutation, and psionics. He possesses
            considerable expertise in other life sciences. He is highly talented
            in devising equipment for utilizing and enhancing psionic powers.
            Xavier is also quite the masterful tactician and strategist,
            effectively evaluating situations and devising swift responses; he
            has, on numerous occasions, even fashioned long-term operations as
            complex as those of adversaries such as Sinister, Magneto, and
            Apocalypse

          <h3>X-Men</h3>
          <p>
            Professor Xavier later met with Fred Duncan, an FBI agent
            investigating the growing number of mutants. Professor Xavier told
            Duncan of his plan to locate young mutants and enroll them in his
            "School for Gifted Youngsters", using his ancestral mansion home as
            a base to train them to use their powers, as well as provide them
            conventional educations, for humanity's benefit. The base included
            subterranean medical labs, a training facility called the "Danger
            Room", an aircraft hanger with a Stratojet, and Professor Xavier's
            mutant detection device, code-named "Cerebro". Amelia stayed with
            Professor Xavier, partially because she loved him, but also to
            convince him to give up his nonsense idea. On the anniversary of his
            liberation from the Vernichtungslager Extermination Camp, Professor
            Xavier and Amelia met with Erik, now calling himself Magneto and
            wearing a costume and helmet designed to shield from telepathy, in
            Auschwitz, Poland. Professor Xavier pleaded with Magneto that the
            actions he would set into motion were no different than what the
            Nazis did to him years earlier. After both men reminded each other
            that they had the power to destroy one another, Magneto left, with
            Professor Xavier hoping that he saw the error of his ways.

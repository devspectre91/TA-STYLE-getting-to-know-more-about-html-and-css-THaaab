        <h1>The River Ganga</h1>
        <p>
          The upper phase of the river Ganges begins at the confluence of the
          Bhagirathi and Alaknanda rivers in the town of Devprayag in the
          Garhwal division of the Indian state of Uttarakhand. The Bhagirathi is
          considered to be the source in Hindu culture and mythology, although
          the Alaknanda is longer, and therefore, hydrologically the source
          stream.[11][12] The headwaters of the Alakananda are formed by snow
          melt from peaks such as Nanda Devi, Trisul, and Kamet. The Bhagirathi
          rises at the foot of Gangotri Glacier, at Gomukh, at an elevation of
          4,356 m (14,291 ft) and being mythologically referred to as residing
          in the matted locks of Shiva; symbolically Tapovan, which is a meadow
          of ethereal beauty at the feet of Mount Shivling, just 5 km (3.1 mi)
          away
        </p>
        <p>
          Although many small streams comprise the headwaters of the Ganges, the
          six longest and their five confluences are considered sacred. The six
          headstreams are the Alaknanda, Dhauliganga, Nandakini, Pindar,
          Mandakini and Bhagirathi. Their confluences, known as the Panch
          Prayag, are all along the Alaknanda. They are, in downstream order,
          Vishnuprayag, where the Dhauliganga joins the Alaknanda; Nandprayag,
          where the Nandakini joins; Karnaprayag, where the Pindar joins;
          Rudraprayag, where the Mandakini joins; and finally, Devprayag, where
          the Bhagirathi joins the Alaknanda to form the Ganges
        </p>
        <p>
          After flowing for 256.90 km (159.63 mi)[14] through its narrow
          Himalayan valley, the Ganges emerges from the mountains at Rishikesh,
          then debouches onto the Gangetic Plain at the pilgrimage town of
          Haridwar.[11] At Haridwar, a dam diverts some of its waters into the
          Ganges Canal, which irrigates the Doab region of Uttar Pradesh,
          whereas the river, whose course has been roughly southwest until this
          point, now begins to flow southeast through the plains of northern
          India.

        <h1>The River Narmada</h1>
        <p>
          The Narmada River, also called the Reva and previously also known as
          Narbada (Nerbudda)[2]. It is also known as "Life Line of Madhya
          Pradesh and Gujarat" for its huge contribution to the state of Madhya
          pradesh and Gujarat in many ways. Narmada rises from Amarkantak
          Plateau in Anuppur district Madhya Pradesh. It forms the traditional
          boundary between North India and South India and flows westwards over
          a length of 1,312 km (815.2 mi) before draining through the Gulf of
          Khambhat into the Arabian Sea, 30 km (18.6 mi) west of Bharuch city of
          Gujarat
        </p>
        <p>
          It is one of only three major rivers in peninsular India that run from
          east to west (longest west flowing river), along with the Tapti River
          and the Mahi River. It is one of the rivers in India that flows in a
          rift valley, flowing west between the Satpura and Vindhya ranges.
          Being the rift valley river, Narmada river does not form delta. Rift
          valley river forms estuaries. The other rivers which flow through rift
          valley include Damodar River in Chota Nagpur Plateau and Tapti. The
          Tapti River and Mahi River also flow through rift valleys, but between
          different ranges.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few kilometres further down near Bareli and the crossing ghat of the
          Agra to Mumbai road, National Highway 3, the Narmada enters the
          Mandleshwar plain, the second basin about 180 km (111.8 mi) long and
          65 km (40.4 mi) wide in the south. The northern strip of the basin is
          only 25 km (15.5 mi). The second valley section is broken only by
          Saheshwar Dhara fall. The early course of about 125 km (77.7 mi) up to
          Markari falls is met with a succession of cataracts and rapids from
          the elevated table land of Malwa to the low level of Gujarat plain.
          Towards the west of this basin, the hills draw very close but soon
          dwindle down.

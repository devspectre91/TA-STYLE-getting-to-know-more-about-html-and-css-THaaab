          Batman has been Gotham City's protector for decades, CEO of Wayne
          Enterprises, Patriarch of the Bat Family and veteran member of the
          Justice League. Batman is a superhero co-created by artist Bob Kane
          and writer Bill Finger. The character made his first appearance in
          Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939). Batman is the secret identity of
          Bruce Wayne. Witnessing the murder of his parents as a child leads him
          to train himself to physical and intellectual perfection and don a
          bat-themed costume in order to fight crime. Batman operates in the
          Batcave, beneath Wayne Manor assisted by his butler Alfred Pennyworth.
          The Dark Knight fights an assortment of villains influenced by the
          characters' roots in film and pulp magazines. Unlike most superheroes,
          he does not possess any superpowers; he makes use (to the best that he
          can) of intellect, detective skills, science and technology, wealth,
          physical prowess, and intimidation in his war on crime.

        <h2>Dawn of Justice?</h2>

          After the apparent death of Superman, Batman saw an individual dressed
          like the Flash appear before him in the Batcave. Insisting that he
          knew him, the individual urged Batman meet with Barry Allen before
          disappearing. Urged by his suspicions, Batman uncovered a button in
          one of the walls and met with Allen. Deciding to investigate this
          together, they began to suspect that ramifications to the timeline
          might have not been caused by Barry, but another influence. At some
          point, he discovered the Joker was still alive and captured the Clown
          Prince of Crime, holding him in the Batcave to help investigate the
          truth of Nth. Batman reformed the Bat-Family with Batwoman and began
          training Duke to become another vigilante for Gotham. Whilst saving a
          falling airplane, Batman received help from two new heroes called
          Gotham and Gotham Girl, two metahumans with powers similar to
          Superman. Seeing them as a potential replacement for him, he took the
          duo under his wing and helped them on the path to becoming Gotham's
          new superheroes. However, after an encounter with Hugo Strange and the
          Psycho Pirate, the two were rendered mentally damaged and, when Gotham
          attacked the city, Batman was forced to fight him until his powers
          drained his body, killing him. Taking Claire under his wing, Batman,
          with the help of the rest of the Bat Family, stopped an attack
          orchestrated by Strange, similar to one of their earliest encounters.

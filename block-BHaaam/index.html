          Upon moving to Metropolis, Clark took a job at the Daily Star and
          prepared himself to act as a vigilante at the age of 22,[4] by having
          several shirts printed with the S-Symbol that had come to Earth with
          him emblazoned on them. His attempt to rescue a young boy caused him
          to reveal himself before he expected to, and the city came to know of
          the superhuman man.[5] Within six months, Clark had fully revealed
          himself and was targeting corrupt businessman Glen Glenmorgan when
          General Sam Lane and Lex Luthor took an interest in him. They staged
          several emergencies to trap him, finally succeeding with a train crash
          that endangered the General's own daughter Lois.[6] In collaboration
          with the military, Luthor tortured Superman while his Kryptonian
          Rocket was studied. Upon his escape, Superman sealed his birth rocket
          away for protection but was too late to prevent its Kryptonian signal
          from alerting the Collector of Worlds to its location - and unaware
          that Luthor was complicit in making that happen.

          Kal-El, the Last Son of Krypton born to scientists Jor-El and Lara
          Lor-Van, was sent in a rocket to Earth as their home planet was
          destroyed. Kal's rocket landed in Smallville, Kansas, where he was
          discovered by Jonathan and Martha Kent. He was given the name "Clark
          Kent" and adopted as their son. Clark learned of his alien origin as
          he grew up and learned to use his powers in secret. On the night of
          his senior prom, because his adoptive parents discouraged Clark from
          becoming a superhero for fear what it could do to him, he failed to
          save Jonathan and Martha from dying in a car accident. However, in a
          further revision to Superman's origin over one year later, Doctor
          Manhattan went through time and saved Alan Scott from dying in a train
          accident, allowing him to become the first Green Lantern and assemble
          the Justice Society of America in the 1900s and set a good example for
          superheroes to come in the future. With role models to look up to and
          no reason to stay in hiding, on the night of his senior prom, Clark
          saved his adoptive parents from dying in a car accident.[87] As an
          adult, Clark moved to Metropolis and adopted the name "Superman". He
          started a job as a reporter at the Daily Planet where he met Lois
          Lane. The two fell in love, and he revealed his secret identity to
          her. Sometime after, Superman was seemingly killed by Doomsday and
          returned to life. Afterwards, Clark and Lois got married. At one
          point, Superman's powers malfunctioned and he temporarily became
          Electric Blue Superman before returning to normal.[88] Later, Lois
          became pregnant with a child, and Clark delivered his son Jonathan
          Samuel Kent in the Fortress of Solitude.[86]

          Later, trying to find a way to make some money, he decided to join the
          superhero team the Fantastic Four. Spidey intruded into the Baxter
          Building, battling the FF, as a way of showing them his power, but the
          team refused Spidey's entry after explaining to him that they did not
          get paid for their actions and that they were a family, not an
          enterprise. Later that day, the Russian criminal and master of
          disguise known as the Chameleon used Spider-Man's identity to steal
          defense missile plans. The real Spidey was used by Chameleon as a pawn
          to escape the scene without problems. After managing to avoid capture
          by the police, Spider-Man caught Chameleon in a helicopter before he
          could reach a soviet submarine and handed him in to the
          authorities.[56] Peter finally found a way to make money when the
          Daily Bugle asked for photos of the winged criminal known as the
          Vulture. Not only did Spider-Man defeat the villain, he also found a
          way to take photos, which caused J.J. Jameson to hire Peter to get him
          pictures of Spider-Man, under the condition that the publicist would
          not ask Peter how he took the pictures.

          Despite misgivings and with the support of his family, Peter initially
          sided with mentor Iron Man in support of superhero registration, after
          being unsure initially, as he felt that heroes needed to get public
          support for their actions. Many of the heroes on that side had public
          identities, with him being the only major supporter without one
          following Iron Man's unmasking; Iron Man also said it was a positive
          thing to unmask if they were to gain support. He planned to liquidate
          his assets and flee the country in case his unmasking caused any
          problems, but his family suggested against it, believing that Peter
          needed to get recognition for his actions. With Iron Man at his side,
          at a live press conference in Washington, D.C., Peter unmasked and
          said: "My name is Peter Parker, and I have been Spider-Man since I was
          15 years old." His siding with the pro-registration heroes also saw
          him gaining the "Iron Spider" armor, which Stark had been building
          since Peter's death and resurrection
